                            <p>Yes! Voice Clock Time Speaker is designed to run continuously in the background. Once you start the announcements and minimize the app, it will keep announcing the time at your chosen intervals even when you're using other apps or your screen is locked.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>We've optimized the app to use minimal battery. The app uses efficient background audio capabilities and only wakes up briefly to announce the time. Most users report negligible battery impact even with continuous use throughout the day.</p>

                        </button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>The app intelligently handles audio interruptions. During phone calls, announcements are paused automatically and resume when the call ends. When playing music, the announcement will briefly lower the music volume, speak the time, and then restore the music to its original level.</p>

                        </button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Background audio permission is required for the app to continue speaking time announcements when you're not actively using the app. This is a standard iOS permission that allows audio apps to function in the background. Without it, the announcements would stop as soon as you leave the app.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Simply open the app and tap the Stop button, or use the Control Center to stop the audio. You can also set up Quiet Hours in the app settings to automatically pause announcements during specific times like sleep hours.</p>

                            <span>Is there a limit to how long announcements can run in the background?</span>
                            <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
                        </button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Yes, due to Apple's iOS system limitations, apps can only schedule a limited number of background announcements (up to 64). Here's how Voice Clock handles this:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Background mode:</strong> Announcements are limited to 64. Once completed, the alarm stops automatically.</li>
                                <li><strong>Foreground mode (app open):</strong> Announcements can continue indefinitely without any limit.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Example:</strong> With 5-minute intervals, background mode supports approximately 5 hours and 20 minutes of announcements (5 min × 64 = 320 minutes).</p>
                            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> For uninterrupted announcements over extended periods, keep the app open. If you need hands-free operation, simply don't open the app after starting an alarm—it will continue in the background until the limit is reached.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">

                            <span>Why does a "Continue Running" dialog appear when I open the app?</span>

                        </button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>When you open the app while an alarm is running in the background, Voice Clock recognizes that you're now actively using your device and switches from automatic background behavior to manual control.</p>
                            <p>The "Continue Running" dialog gives you options to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Continue the alarm:</strong> Keep the announcements going with active control</li>
                                <li><strong>Choose which alarm to continue:</strong> If you have multiple alarms set</li>
                                <li><strong>Stop the alarm:</strong> End announcements entirely</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Want uninterrupted automatic announcements?</strong> Simply don't open the app after starting the alarm. The announcements will continue in the background without any prompts (up to the 64-announcement limit).</p>

                            <p><strong>Clock-Aligned Mode:</strong> Announces at specific clock times. For example, "every 15 minutes" will announce at 9:00, 9:15, 9:30, 9:45, etc. Great for keeping track of time during meetings or classes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Interval Mode:</strong> Announces based on time elapsed since you started. For example, "every 15 minutes" will announce 15 minutes from when you pressed start, then 30 minutes, 45 minutes, etc. Perfect for timing activities like workouts or study sessions.</p>

                            <p>Yes! Quiet Hours let you automatically pause announcements during specific times. Set your sleep schedule (e.g., 10 PM to 7 AM) and the app will stay silent during those hours, then automatically resume when your quiet period ends.</p>
