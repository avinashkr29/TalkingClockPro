                            <p>Yes! Voice Clock Time Speaker is designed to run continuously in the background. Once you start the announcements and minimize the app, it will keep announcing the time at your chosen intervals even when you're using other apps or your screen is locked.</p>

                            <p>We've optimized the app to use minimal battery. The app uses efficient background audio capabilities and only wakes up briefly to announce the time. Most users report negligible battery impact even with continuous use throughout the day.</p>

                            <p><strong>Yes!</strong> Voice Clock is specifically designed to work alongside other audio apps. You can listen to music, podcasts, audiobooks, or any other audio while receiving time announcements.</p>
                            <p>When playing music, the announcement will briefly lower the music volume, speak the time, and then restore the music to its original level. During phone calls, announcements are paused automatically and resume when the call ends.</p>

                            <p>Background audio permission is required for the app to continue speaking time announcements when you're not actively using the app. This is a standard iOS permission that allows audio apps to function in the background. Without it, the announcements would stop as soon as you leave the app.</p>

                            <p>Simply open the app and tap the Stop button, or use the Control Center to stop the audio. You can also set up Quiet Hours in the app settings to automatically pause announcements during specific times like sleep hours.</p>

                        </button>

                            <p><strong>No!</strong> When you start announcements using the Start button from the main page, they can run <strong>infinitely</strong> in the background with no restrictions. The app uses background audio capability to keep announcing the time as long as you need.</p>
                            <p>You can minimize the app, lock your screen, or use other apps—the announcements will continue without any limit.</p>
                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This applies to normal announcements started manually. Scheduled announcements (that start automatically) have different limitations—see the <a href="#scheduled-announcements">Scheduled Announcements</a> section for details.</p>

                            <p>Siri voices are proprietary to Apple and are exclusively controlled by them. Apple intentionally keeps Siri's voice separate from third-party apps to maintain a clear distinction between Siri (Apple's assistant) and other app voices.</p>
                            <p>Because of this restriction, Apple does not allow apps like Voice Clock to access Siri voices. The app displays all voices that Apple makes available to developers for your device—which still includes many high-quality options across multiple languages and accents.</p>

                                <li><strong>Internet dependency:</strong> AI voices require a constant internet connection, which isn't always available</li>
                                <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Network issues could cause announcements to fail or be delayed</li>
                                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Cloud AI services would significantly increase the app's operating costs, which would need to be passed on to users</li>

                            <p>Currently, the speed of seconds announcements cannot be adjusted. Here's why:</p>
                            <p>When announcing seconds like "55" or "59," the spoken words take longer to say than smaller numbers like "1" or "5." The announcement must complete within one second before the next second arrives. Different languages also have varying word lengths for numbers—some languages require more syllables to express the same number.</p>
                            <p>To ensure accurate, real-time announcements across all supported languages, the seconds announcement uses a faster, optimized pace. This guarantees that even longer numbers are fully spoken before the next second begins.</p>

                            <p>When you open the app while a <strong>scheduled alarm</strong> is running in the background, Voice Clock lists all currently announcing schedules. The app recognizes that you're awake and able to manually control the announcements, so it switches from automatic background behavior to manual control.</p>
                            <p>The "Continue Running" dialog gives you options to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Continue the alarm actively:</strong> Keep the announcements going with active control</li>
                                <li><strong>Choose which alarm to continue:</strong> If you have multiple alarms set</li>

                            <p><strong>Bonus:</strong> By opening the app and choosing to continue, you can now run the announcements <strong>infinitely</strong>—bypassing Apple's 64-announcement background limit!</p>
                            <p><strong>Want the alarm to continue automatically without interruption?</strong> Simply leave it running and don't open the app. It will continue in the background up to the 64-announcement limit.</p>
